\title{Remove isolated pieces from a surface mesh or split into connected components}
\usage{
vcgIsolated(mesh, facenum = NULL, diameter = NULL, split = FALSE,
  silent = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mesh}{triangular mesh of class "mesh3d".}

\item{facenum}{integer: all connected pieces with less components are
removed. If not specified or 0 and diameter is NULL, then only the component
with the most faces is kept.}

\item{diameter}{numeric: all connected pieces smaller diameter are removed
removed. \code{diameter = 0} removes all component but the largest ones. This option overrides the option \code{facenum}.}

\item{split}{logical: if TRUE, a list with all connected components of the mesh will be returned.}

\item{silent}{logical, if TRUE no console output is issued.}
}
\value{
returns the reduced mesh.
}
\description{
Remove isolated pieces from a surface mesh, selected by a
minimum amount of faces or of a diameter below a given threshold.
Also the option only to keep the largest piece can be selected or to split a mesh into connected components.
